# Advent of Code 2022

## :santa: About Advent Of Code
Each December [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) creates and shares 25 pairs of challenges with the tech community for free. It's been going since 2015 and is increasing in popularity each year!

In my experience, the challenges tend to start out easy enough for even a beginner to brute force, but usually by day 9 or 10 the difficulty ramps up. Between the difficulty, December's busy schedule, and my ADHD, I've never made it past day 12ish. Is this the year I finally make it to Christmas??

## :snowman: My Approach
- I'll be solving the challenges using JavaScript, maybe TypeScript at times if I'm feeling fancy. 

- I'm not a data manipulation pro, so I'll usually just format the data into whatever data structure I want via VSCode find and replace and some RegEx googling. Often the data manipulation is what takes me the longest.

- Most days I'll share my brute force, initial approach and then a cleaned up solution. There are good odds my initial approaches will have shockingly bad time complexity, but I can live with it. Usually I'll try to reduce that or at least throw in a method where appropriate for the cleaned up version. 

- Don't expect to see me on the [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard)! The people there are mind-blowingly fast and take solving coding challenges to another level. Lots of the stream or record their attempts if you feel like checking them out.
